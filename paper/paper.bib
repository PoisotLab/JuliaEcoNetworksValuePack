  abstract = {The modularity of a network quantifies the extent, relative to a null model network, to which vertices cluster into community groups. We define a null model appropriate for bipartite networks, and use it to define a bipartite modularity. The bipartite modularity is presented in terms of a modularity matrix B; some key properties of the eigenspectrum of B are identified and used to describe an algorithm for identifying modules in bipartite networks. The algorithm is based on the idea that the modules in the two parts of the network are dependent, with each part mutually being used to induce the vertices for the other part into the modules. We apply the algorithm to real-world network data, showing that the algorithm successfully identifies the modular structure of bipartite networks.},

  abstract = {Most studies of plant–animal mutualisms involve a small number of species. There is almost no information on the structural organization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

  abstract = {Food-web structure mediates dramatic effects of biodiversity loss including secondary and `cascading' extinctions. We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience `rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

  abstract = {Networks from a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems have been recently described as “small-world” and “scale-free.” However, studies disagree whether ecological networks called food webs possess the characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions required for membership in these classes of networks. Our analysis suggests that the disagreements are based on selective use of relatively few food webs, as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25–172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that although some food webs have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal functional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power–law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.},

  abstract = {Bipartite networks are ubiquitous in community ecology, including examples of facilitative interactions, such as plant-pollinator networks, and antagonistic interactions, such as virus–host infection networks. Statistical network analysis is increasingly used to identify emergent, nonrandom patterns of interaction and the effect of interaction patterns on ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Two recurring patterns are that of modularity and nestedness. Modularity is a feature of networks in which there are densely interacting subgroups. Nestedness is a feature of networks in which the interactions form ordered subsets. Here we describe BiMat, an open-source MATLAB package for the study of the structure of bipartite ecological networks. Unlike alternative tools, BiMat enables both multiscale analysis of the structure of a bipartite ecological network – spanning global (i.e. entire network) to local (i.e. module-level) scales – and meta-analyses of many bipartite networks simultaneously. In common with other tools, BiMat calculates the degree to which a bipartite network is modular and/or nested, the statistical significance of these patterns, and enables visualization of latent structures in the network. BiMat is available as an open-source MATLAB package, with a quick-start guide and worked examples at: http://bimat.github.io/.},

However, no study has yet explored the dynamical implications of network structure for the persistence of such mutualistic communities. Here, we develop a patch-model of a whole plant–animal community and explore its persistence. To assess the role of network structure, we build three versions of the model. In the first version, we use the exact network of interactions of two real mutualistic communities. In the other versions, we randomize the observed network of interactions using two different null models. We show that the community response to habitat loss is affected by network structure. Real communities start to decay sooner than random communities, but persist for higher destruction levels. There is a destruction threshold at which the community collapses. Our model is the first attempt to describe the dynamics of whole mutualistic metacommunities interacting in realistic ways.},

  abstract = {1. Understanding the structure of ecological networks is a crucial task for interpreting community and ecosystem responses to global change. 2. Despite the recent interest in this subject, almost all studies have focused exclusively on one specific network property. The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns. 3. Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant-animal mutualistic and host-parasite networks. 4. We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities. 5. The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it. 6. A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities.},

  abstract = {Interactions connect the units of ecological systems, forming networks. Individual-based networks characterize variation in niches among individuals within populations. These individual-based networks merge with each other, forming species-based networks and food webs that describe the architecture of ecological communities. Networks at broader spatiotemporal scales portray the structure of ecological interactions across landscapes and over macroevolutionary time. Here, I review the patterns observed in ecological networks across multiple levels of biological organization. A fundamental challenge is to understand the amount of interdependence as we move from individual-based networks to species-based networks and beyond. Despite the uneven distribution of studies, regularities in network structure emerge across scales due to the fundamental architectural patterns shared by complex networks and the interplay between traits and numerical effects. I illustrate the integration of these organizational scales by exploring the consequences of the emergence of highly connected species for network structures across scales.

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure has attracted considerable recent attention. One of the most sensitive detection methods is optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network, but direct application of this method using, for instance, simulated annealing is computationally costly. Here we show that the modularity can be reformulated in terms of the eigenvectors of a new characteristic matrix for the network, which we call the modularity matrix, and that this reformulation leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of better quality than competing methods in noticeably shorter running times. We demonstrate the algorithm with applications to several network data sets.},

  abstract = {There is a growing realization among community ecologists that interactions between species vary across space and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our current numerical framework to analyse the structure of species interactions, based on graph-theoretical approaches, usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of network structure so that they can exploit it. We present analytical expressions of key measures of network structured, adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its variance. When applied to non-probabilistic data, the measures we present give the same results as their non-probabilistic formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We present three case studies that highlight how these measures can be used, in re-analysing data that experimentally measured the variability of interactions, to alleviate the computational demands of permutation-based approaches, and to use the frequency at which interactions are observed over several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

  abstract = {Ecologists are fascinated by the prevalence of nestedness in biogeographic and community data, where it is thought to promote biodiversity in mutualistic systems. Traditionally, nestedness has been treated in a binary sense: species and their interactions are either present or absent, neglecting information on abundances and interaction frequencies. Extending nestedness to quantitative data facilitates the study of species preferences, and we propose a new detection method that follows from a basic property of bipartite networks: large dominant eigenvalues are associated with highly nested configurations. We show that complex ecological networks are binary nested, but quantitative preferences are non-nested, indicating limited consumer overlap of favoured resources. The spectral graph approach provides a formal link to local dynamical stability analysis, where we demonstrate that nested mutualistic structures are minimally stable. We conclude that, within the binary constraint of interaction plausibility, species preferences are partitioned to avoid competition, thereby benefiting system-wide resource allocation. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Aim The identification of compartments (i.e. clusters of overlapping species ranges across an environmental gradient) is an important methodological challenge for biogeographical studies. Recent developments in network theory offer promising perspectives on this issue using the measurement of modularity. A presence–absence matrix is modular if particular subgroups of species are mainly linked to particular subgroups of sites. Modularity is still rarely considered in biogeographical studies. Here, I compare different modularity indices to investigate which is the most appropriate for studying presence–absence matrices and similar types of networks, such as bipartite networks. Location Evaluation was based on 279 data sets from around the world. Methods I consider the three most commonly used modularity indices. One was developed for unipartite networks and the other two for bipartite networks. The performance of these indices (detection of a modular pattern, quality of compartment identification) is evaluated on test matrices of known compartmentalization levels with varying sizes and fills. Modularity patterns are then evaluated for 279 presence–absence matrices. Results The three modularity measures differ mainly in the identification of the compartments, and less in the statistical significance of the observed modularity. The modularity measure Q3 tends to perform best, whereas Q2 usually performs less well, especially for highly diverse and highly connected networks that include a few extremely well-connected nodes. These modularity indices all reveal the presence of modular patterns in presence–absence matrices. Main conclusions The choice of an appropriate modularity index is particularly important when we are interested in the composition of the different compartments. This analysis suggests that compartmentalized structures can be widespread in presence–absence matrices (about 40\% of the matrices considered here). Modularity should thus offer interesting perspectives on the understanding of biogeographical patterns.},
